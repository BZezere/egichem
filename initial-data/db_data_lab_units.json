        "description": "Conceived and assembled by EGICHEM, this unit is devoted to performing catalytic reaction experiments between atmospheric pressure till a maximum pressure of 55 bar and temperatures of reaction from 25 \u00baC till 500 \u00baC",
        "equipment": "Syringe pump, mass flow controller, stainless steel tubular reactor with 80.4 cm3 capacity, tempeature PID controller, tubular furnace. Pressure is regulated by a back pressure regulator operated manually. The gas and liquid products are analyzed in a Fast GC equipped with a FID detector, and a VB-1 (ValcoBond, VICI) capillary non-polar column. Unit is controlled using built-in interface with on-line data acquisition.",
